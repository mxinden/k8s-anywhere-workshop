## Abstract

CoreOS Tectonic makes it trivial to deploy same configuration Kubernetes
clusters on multiple cloud providers. All based on open-source technologies. No
matter what platform you are running on, the Tectonic installer lets you easily
set up your Kubernetes cluster including Prometheus - a cloud native monitoring
tool. Alex and Max help you get started bringing up your Kubernetes cluster and
setting up cluster and application monitoring with Prometheus.
